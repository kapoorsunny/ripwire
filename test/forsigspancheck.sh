# forsigspancheck.sh — a --for <d> row says where its definition ENDS (e=), the one-hop slots go to top rows whose
# edges are proven, and the defining code outranks the docs that describe it.
#
#   test/forsigspancheck.sh                          # uses build/ripwire on test/forcompletefix
#   RIPWIRE_BIN=asan/ripwire test/forsigspancheck.sh
#   test/forsigspancheck.sh build_base/ripwire       # the RED run (a pre-change binary)
#
# THE GAPS (each seen in graded answers; the fixture paraphrases them as minimal code):
#   (1) SPAN. A <d> row carried only l= (the line of the definition's name). "Which body holds line N" — the question a
#       reader asks of every gold item that lives INSIDE a function — was not answerable from the row; a peer that
#       printed start-end lines got the credit.
#   (2) HOP SLOT. The compact answer hop-expands its ranked head in rank order and the first row with ANY resolved
#       callee took the slot: an off-topic getter whose one callee row was a call bound by name alone (`bag.lookup()`
#       on an untyped local) spent the slot and printed a false edge.
#   (3) DOCS FIRST. Markdown headings that repeat the question's words filled the ranked rows above the code that
#       defines the answer (on one graded answer about half of the shown rows were headings).
#
# THE CONTRACT.
#   (1) Every <d> row of a --for answer whose definition extent is KNOWN carries e="N" right after l=: the 1-based line
#       of the definition's LAST line (body-inclusive; a declaration's own last line; e == l for a one-line definition).
#       l= keeps its meaning (the NAME's line), so a definition may start above l= (a return type on the line before,
#       a decorator). e= is ABSENT — never 0, never a guess — when the extent is not known: a row flagged
#       extent_suspect=, a markdown/doc row (not a code body). Other verbs keep their bytes (no e= outside --for).
#   (2) A hop slot (<h> row) goes only to a top-ranked row with at least ONE proven callee edge; a row whose every
#       callee edge was bound by name alone gets no <h> row. Rows that keep a slot keep it in rank order.
#   (3) When the question does not name docs, no markdown row ranks above the code rows that define the answer, and
#       markdown rows are at most a quarter of the shown <d> rows. A question that names docs still gets a docs row
#       in its top five (the twin that must hold).
#
# ARMS (one fixture root per language under test/forcompletefix/; each indexed on its own):
#   (E)  e= values: C Sampler_average l=6 e=14 (return type on the line above the name), Sampler_scale l=3 e=3
#        (a one-line definition), the header prototype Sampler_collectAll l=57 e=57; TS createContext l=11 e=18 (a
#        multi-line signature), handle l=20 e=22; Python _compute l=12 e=13 (a decorator above), evict_entries l=15
#        e=20 (a multi-line signature). Oracle on EVERY row that carries e=: l <= e <= the file's line count, and
#        the e= line closes the definition (brace languages, unless e == l: the line holds `}` or ends with `;`/`)`; Python: the next
#        non-blank line is indented no deeper than the def, or EOF). e= sits right after l=.
#   (U)  unknown extent: Sampler_window and SampleWindow (extent_suspect="head") and every docs/*.md row carry NO
#        e=; every other <d> row carries one (a present e= is never dropped silently either).
#   (B)  an explicit --token-budget TIGHTER than the default signature budget (1200 tokens): no e= row and no e= clause,
#        XML and JSON (the budget's rows and est_tokens promise stay what they were; charging e= there cost rows, exempting
#        it broke the promise). Twin: --token-budget=8000 (above the default share) carries e= on its rows.
#   (O)  outside --for: --pack-signatures <d> rows and the default map's rows carry no e=.
#   (H)  hop slots: TS — contextHost (only callee: a name-only `bag.lookup()`) has no <h> row; createContext keeps
#        one. Python — Downloader.pull (only callee: a name-only `source.fetch_entry()`) has no <h> row; fetch_entry
#        keeps one. C near miss — Sampler_collectAll keeps its <h> row. <h> rows follow the <d> rows' r= order.
#        The two "no <h> row" arms need the receiver-evidence hedge (a name-only row marked via="name"); on a binary
#        without it they SKIP by name ("expects FE-B"), detected on this fixture — never a silent PASS.
#   (R)  code above docs as a REORDER of the shown set (coordinator rule: it reorders, never shrinks the doc rows shown):
#        the TS questions answered with the rule and with RIPWIRE_NO_DOCS_AFTER_CODE=1 (plain score order) show the
#        same row SET and r= multiset; with the rule every code row precedes every doc row, rows stay in r= order, and
#        <sigs docs_after_code="N"> counts the doc rows that moved (with its reading). Near misses: the same at a
#        --token-budget that cuts <sigs> (a demotion would evict docs there: red on the score-demotion build), and a
#        question whose topic ("dropped after the response") only a docs row names keeps that row. Twin: "Where do the
#        docs describe the context lifecycle?" keeps a docs row in its top five.
#   (T)  a TIGHT explicit ceiling (--token-budget / MCP budget_tokens below the default signature share) gets neither the
#        reorder nor its uncharged note: the answer is byte-equal to the RIPWIRE_NO_DOCS_AFTER_CODE=1 twin (which is the
#        pre-reorder answer), XML, JSON and MCP, at 700 and 1200 on the TS fixture; at 1200 the XML/JSON est_tokens stay
#        within the budget with no over_ceiling the twin lacks (RED at 9d0ad7aa: est 1277 > 1200, over_ceiling="1").
#        MCP est_tokens is the twin's (already above 1200 on base; not this rule's to fix). Near misses: no ceiling and
#        --token-budget=8000 still reorder and carry docs_after_code= with its reading, XML, JSON and MCP; a question that
#        names docs keeps score order at 1200 too.
#        A BODY ceiling (--max-tokens=N --detail=K, XML only: --json refuses the pair, MCP `for` has no max_tokens) is the third tight
#        ceiling: the same twin equality, est_tokens <= N, on the TS fixture at 1600 and the Python+docs fixture (pydocs) at 1660
#        (RED at f4253d45: est 1634 > 1600 / 1725 > 1660, over_ceiling="1"); near miss --detail alone still reorders.
#   (J)  dialect parity: --for --json "sigs" entries carry "e" equal to the XML rows' e= (and none where XML has none).
#   (M)  the MCP `for` twin: the same e= on the C rows, none on the extent_suspect rows, and a legend clause for e=.
#   (L)  legend: --legend=full defines e= and says what it does NOT mean (absent = unknown, not 0; l= is the name's
#        line, not the definition's first line).
#   (N)  the experimental RIPWIRE_FOR_ENDLINES switch (serialize.h forEndLinesMode; default auto = arm (B)'s rule):
#        always — e= on the --token-budget=1200 rows, XML and JSON, and on the MCP `for` rows under budget_tokens=1200,
#        with the SAME <d> row set (n p l r) as auto there (e= never costs a row); est_tokens vs the budget is REPORTED
#        (may exceed it — that is why auto is the default), not gated. never — no e= and no e= clause at the default
#        ceiling (XML, JSON, MCP), same row set as auto. auto — byte-identical to unset (default and 1200). An unknown
#        value ("sometimes", "Always", "") — byte-identical to unset (so e= stays at the default: never read as never)
#        plus one stderr line naming the switch. Near miss: always does not put e= on --pack-signatures rows.
#   (K)  the predicates can fail: a row with e= < l=, a row with e= on an md row, a missing e= on a code row, and a
#        name-only hop row are each caught; a document with no --for root is never a pass. Every run must exit 0.
#
# FLOORS — named, not gated here:
#   * e= is the parser's span: a definition spliced by the preprocessor or a recovered parse is covered only by
#     extent_suspect= (rows with an unflagged but wrong span are not detected).
#   * the code-over-docs rule is checked on one fixture; the threshold for "names docs" is the question's wording.
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
